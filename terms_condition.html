            <h2>Terms of Talent Booking</h2>
            <h3>Agreement</h3>
            <div class="condition">
                <p>Before proceeding with talent booking, it is imperative that the individual (the ‘Client’ defined as
                    ‘You’ or ‘Your’ as the context allows) for which this document has been made reads, understands,
                    acknowledges and accepts the terms as set out in this document (the ‘Agreement’), which forms a
                    binding legal agreement between You and Influencer Hacki.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If You proceed with talent booking, it is Your intention to permit ‘Influencer Hacki’, ‘Us’ or ‘We’
                    to facilitate a marketing campaign, social media campaign, guest speaking, corporate event and/or
                    engagement of a similar nature (‘Engagement’), between You and an influencer, vlogger, journalist,
                    PR specialist, content creator or celebrity (the ‘Talent’) as chosen by You from the online Business
                    platform (‘Website’).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By proceeding with talent booking, You warrant in favour of Influencer Hacki that you:

                    <br>
                    <br>


                    a) are 18 years of age or older;
                    <br>
                    b) have authority or the valid delegated authority to proceed with Confirmation; and
                    <br>
                    c) have read, understood, agreed to and accept all of the terms, conditions and obligations
                    contained in this Agreement and arising as a result of Your Confirmation.
                    <br>
                    You understand and accept that: given Inluencer Hacki’s faciliatory role in the Engagement, the
                    Talent is not a party to this Agreement, but a third party; and the Engagement itself comprises a
                    separate contract between You and the Talent (and does not include Influencer Hacki) as to
                    performance and consideration of that contract. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This Agreement governs Your relationship with Influencer Hacki only as to the facilitation of the
                    Talent through the Website (‘Parties’) and insofar as You have an issue and/or dispute with the
                    Talent in connection with the Engagement, this is not a matter to be raised by You under this
                    Agreement and Influencer Hacki has no liability to you in respect of the Engagement with the Talent.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1 Registration and account
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    1.1 In order to use the Website (or certain features thereof) You may be required to create an
                    account ('Account').
                    <br>
                    1.2 You acknowledge and agree that:
                    <br>
                    1.2.1 all the information provided in creating an Account is correct, complete and accurate (and not
                    misleading or deceptive in any way) (‘Registration Details’); and
                    <br> 1.2.2 if the Registration Details change at any time, it is Your responsibility to access the
                    Website and update Your Registration Details as necessary to remain in compliance with Your
                    obligations under this Agreement.
                    <br>
                    1.3 Influencer Hacki reserves the right to terminate this Agreement effective immediately if any
                    Registration Details are found to be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading and/or not current.
                    <br>
                    1.4 You acknowledge that Influencer Hacki may use and process the Registration Details for the
                    purposes of managing Your Account.
                    <br>
                    1.5 As part of creating Your Account, You are required to select a password. You acknowledge and
                    agree that maintaining the confidentiality of the password associated with Your Account is solely
                    Your responsibility.
                    <br>
                    1.6 You agree to notify Influencer Hacki immediately of any unauthorised use of Your Account or any
                    other breach of security including the dissemination of Your Account password.
                    <br>
                    1.7 Influencer Hacki accepts no liability for any loss incurred by You as a result of any third
                    party or unsanctioned access to Your Account, either with or without Your knowledge.
                    <br>
                    1.8 You acknowledge that You may be held liable for losses incurred by Influencer Hacki and/or any
                    other party (including Talent) as a result of a third party accessing Your Account.
                    <br>
                    1.9 Influencer Hacki’s use of Your Registration details and other information associated with Your
                    Account is set out in the associated Privacy Policy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2 Fees <br>
                    <br>
                    2.1 The monetary fee as outlined in the Engagement booking (‘Engagement Fee’) is the fee You are
                    required to pay for the Engagement, exclusive of tax.
                    <br>
                    2.2 You will be required to pay any tax in addition to the Engagement Fee.
                    <br>
                    2.3 By proceeding with Confirmation, this signifies Your acceptance of the Engagement Fee as
                    outlined.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3 Time for Payment <br>
                    <br>

                    3.1 You agree to pay the Engagement Fee (time being of the essence in all material respects) in the
                    following manner:
                    <br>
                    3.1.1 the first half of the Engagement Fee (initial 50% payment) must be paid within seven (7) days
                    of Booking Confirmation; and
                    <br>
                    3.1.2 the second and final half of the Engagement Fee (second and final 50% payment) must be made no
                    later than seven (7) days prior to the date of the Engagement (‘Engagement Date’).
                    <br>
                    3.2 However, if the Engagement Date is within seven (7) days of Confirmation, payment of the
                    Engagement Fee in its entirety must be paid immediately.
                    <br>
                    3.3 You acknowledge that the Engagement is only confirmed and booked by Influencer Hacki once
                    payment in accordance with either clause 3.1.1 or clause 3.2, as the situation may be, is made to
                    Influencer Hacki. If payment is not forthcoming by You in accordance with this clause 3, You
                    acknowledge that the Talent may accept other booking requests and the prospective engagement may be
                    terminated. Any such termination will be treated as a cancellation of the Engagement by You and
                    handled in accordance with clause 4.
                    <br>
                    3.4 Payment of any kind as referred to in this clause 3 is to be made by electronic funds transfer
                    (‘EFT’) or via credit card medium through the Website as and when directed by Influencer Hacki upon
                    Your Confirmation.
                    <br>
                    3.5 Influencer Hacki will forward the Engagement Fee (less any commission as agreed between
                    Influencer Hacki and the Talent) to the Talent following Your confirmation that the Client attended
                    the Engagement.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4 Client Cancellations <br>
                    <br>

                    4.1 If You cancel Your Engagement for any or no reason:
                    <br>
                    4.1.1 more than seventy-two (72) hours before the Engagement Date, Influencer Hacki will (subject to
                    clause 3.2) retain half of the Engagement Fee (50% paid) and You authorise and release those funds
                    to Influencer Hacki by way of this Agreement; or
                    <br>
                    4.1.2 within seventy-two (72) hours before the Engagement Date, Influencer Hacki will retain the
                    entirety of the Engagement Fee (100% paid) and You authorise and release those funds to Influencer
                    Hacki by way of this Agreement.
                    <br>
                    4.2 If the Engagement Date falls on or about a public holiday and/or during any other period of high
                    Talent request (‘Request Period’):
                    <br>
                    4.2.1 Influencer Hacki will notify You by email that Your Engagement Date falls within a Request
                    Period; and
                    <br>
                    4.2.2 if You cancel the Engagement falling within a Request Period more than seventy-two (72) hours
                    before the Engagement Date, Influencer Hacki will retain the entirety of the Engagement Fee (100%
                    paid) and you authorise and release those funds to Influencer Hacki by way of this Agreement.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    5 Talent Cancellations <br>
                    <br>

                    5.1 You warrant in favour of Influencer Hacki that You accept that:
                    <br>
                    5.1.1 the Talent, as chosen by You, may for any reason become unavailable or unable to attend the
                    Engagement and that We accept no liability or responsibility of any kind for the Talent’s
                    cancellation and/or failure to attend;
                    <br>
                    5.1.2 in this circumstance, We will use reasonable endeavours to arrange a talent in substitution
                    (‘Alternative Talent’) to attend the Engagement;
                    <br>
                    5.1.3 if Alternative Talent can be agreed upon by You and Us, You will be deemed to enter into a new
                    Engagement directly with that Alternative Talent, in the manner described for Engagements of Talent
                    generally in this Agreement; and
                    <br>
                    5.1.4 if no Alternative Talent can be agreed upon by You and Us (or facilitated by Us), We will
                    refund to You the full amount of the Engagement Fee You had paid prior to the cancelation.
                    <br>
                    5.2 We accept no liability or responsibility whatsoever for any damage or cost You may incur:
                    <br>
                    5.2.1 as a result of Talent cancellation;
                    <br>
                    5.2.2 the state in which the Talent attends the Engagement; or
                    <br>
                    5.2.3 any statements or actions made by the Talent at the Engagement.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    6 Promotion & Advertising <br>
                    <br>

                    6.1 You must not use any biographical or any other information about the Talent to promote the
                    Engagement unless Influencer Hacki has granted You prior written consent to do so. Subject to such
                    consent, You may only use biographical or any other information about the Talent that has been
                    supplied by Influencer Hacki.
                    <br>
                    6.2 Any promotional materials You intend to use in promoting the Engagement must be submitted to
                    Influencer Hacki for approval, prior to implementation and/or distribution. Influencer Hacki will
                    not accept any promotional material which includes any licensed imagery and/or connotation.
                    <br>
                    6.3 It is Your responsibility to ensure no portion of the Engagement is recorded in any permanent
                    form, which captures the Talent’s appearance, if Influencer Hacki has not granted You prior written
                    consent to do so.
                    <br>
                    6.4 Your use of permanent recordings for promotional or commercial purposes also requires prior
                    written consent by Influencer Hacki.
                    <br>
                    6.5 If You fail to comply with the requirement of consent in any provision under this clause 5,
                    Influencer Hacki accepts no liability or responsibility whatsoever for damage, loss or liability
                    arising out of Your advertising or dissemination of content related to the Talent and/or in
                    contravention of any pre-existing sponsorships, agreements or arrangements the Talent may have (and
                    You indemnify and fully hold harmless Influencer Hacki against any loss or damages sustained by You
                    in connection with either Yours or the Talent’s breach of this clause 5).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    7 The Engagement <br>
                    <br>

                    7.1 If You agree to an Engagement with Talent:
                    <br>
                    7.1.1 a separate and distinct contract is formed between the Talent and the Client on the terms
                    of
                    the Engagement (which does not have Influencer Hacki as a party to it);
                    <br>
                    7.1.2 You agree and undertake to only contact the talent through the online chatroom between You
                    and
                    the talent as facilitated on the Website (‘Chatroom’), for the purposes of agreeing to any
                    further
